# Fasta Tools

Some tools and scripts that assists with manupilating FASTA formatted files.

## Description

### cfasta_cleaner.py
Takes a fasta file, and rewrites it in a standard format. This ensures that there are no white spaces in the file and that the sequence entries are of the same lenght. This came about when an error popped up using cuffmerge (see http://seqanswers.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-14419.html for a similar issue) with a 'dirty' fasta file.
